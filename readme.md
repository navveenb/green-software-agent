## 🚀 What is it?

The Green Software Researcher Agent is an AI-powered assistant that provides **research-backed insights** to developers, architects, AI practitioners, and infrastructure engineers on how to create **greener, more energy-efficient software**.

This project is built around the principles of the [Green Software Foundation (GSF)](https://greensoftware.foundation) and aims to make **sustainability a first-class citizen** in the software development lifecycle.

---

## 🌍 Based on GSF’s Three Key Principles:

- **Energy Efficiency**: Write code that consumes less energy  
- **Hardware Efficiency**: Maximize the work done per unit of hardware  
- **Carbon Awareness**: Run workloads when and where energy is cleaner  

---

## 🔧 What Can You Do with the Agent?

Ask questions like:

- _How to write energy-efficient code in Java?_  
- _How to build energy-efficient LLM API applications?_  
- _How to assess the environmental impact of my backend system?_  
- _What tools support carbon-aware cloud deployments?_  

The agent supports:

- **Discovery** of green practices and tools  
- **Analysis** of trade-offs and sustainable design decisions  
- **Insight generation** tailored to your role and goals  

---

## 📦 How It Works

- Uses **trusted LLM providers**
- Sources **publicly available data**
- Responds with curated and contextual answers
- Hosted and maintained at: [https://greensoftware.ai](https://greensoftware.ai)
